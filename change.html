            <h3>Misconceptions About Sustainable Consumption</h3>
            <p>Although sustainable consumption is a very note-wrothy topic, there are some common misconceptions about it. For example, most people do not understand what it really entails and tend to generalize it. Such as addressing eco-labeling and new finance. Sustainable consumption includes details of changes needed to be made to create a balanced ecosystem. If waste is continuously thrown on the ground, the ecosystem will be disrupted as plastic is not biodegradable. The same goes for polluting Earthâ€™s oceans and lakes.</p>

            <h3>Making a Change</h3>
            <p>We need to change our daily lifestyles and be more conscious of our actions as they do make a difference. Even small changes in large numbers can really change the ecosystem for the better. Society can make these changes and work together in order to hit the goal of having sustainable consumption for a healthier Earth. </p>

                <h3>Reducing your Waste</h3>
                <p>Surprisely, everyday waste is not being efficiently recycled, if it is recycled at all. Residents living in the United States are expected to recycle and are provided with specific trash cans for that reason. However, not enough of it is actually being efficiently recycled. By actively picking up trash, not littering , and recycling your waste, can lead to a cleaner, healthier ecosystem.</p>

                <h3>Shopping Sustainably</h3>
                <p>Even through your everyday purchases can you make a change. This is including but not limited to, using reusable shopping bags so the number of bags that end up in an ocean are reduced. Buying refillable products instead of singular use products. Not to mention, buying clothing from a reliable source and not from a huge textile industry, since they are known to pollute the Earth with their scraps.</p>
