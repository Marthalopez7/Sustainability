            <h3>The Issue</h3>
            <p>The unstable patterns of sustainability throughout history have caused the deterioration of Earth’s ecosystem. Trends in product production and consumption have taken a toll on the ecosystem, causing it to deteriorate. Some of the causes for environmental deterioration are excessive food waste, hazardous waste, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and electronic waste. A change needs to be made for the ecosystem to bounce back and renew itself. Earth is the number one recycler! </p>
